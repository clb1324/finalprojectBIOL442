Description: This package contains three functions that work with pet registration data from one city. The functions will clean the registration data, give the number of registered pets and the dog-to-cat ratio in each ZIP code of the city, and can produce pie charts that show the breed breakdown of dogs or cats in the ZIP code of interest.
